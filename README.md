# üìä ImbBag

Imbalanced Bagging Ensemble Algorithms

## üìú Description

ImbBag is a specialized package that integrates a variety of bagging ensemble methods specifically designed for imbalanced data classification. This package provides a scikit-learn-based framework that simplifies the usage of these methods, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to apply them in their work, whether dealing with binary or multi-class classification problems.

## üõ† Installation

```bash
pip install imbbag
```

The following Python packages are required.

* scikit-learn
* imblearn 
* PyGAD 
* ARFS 
* mlxtend
* scikit-learn-intelex

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Get Started

Here is an example:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn. model_selection import train_test_split
from ImbBag import BBag

dataframe = read_csv('dataset.csv')
data = dataframe.values    
X = data[:,:-1]
Y = data[:,:-1]

# split the dataset into training and test sets
X_train ,X_test ,y_train ,y_test = train_test_split (X, y, test_size =0.2)

# instantiate the imbalance bagging classifier, training, prediction 
cls = BBag(estimator = DecisionTreeClassifier(), n_estimator = 50)
clf.fit(X_train , y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
```
